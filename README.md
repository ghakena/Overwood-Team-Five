# Overwood-Team-Five
A team project to re-model the current Overwood website.

By default, I (Gibbs) have created the different sections that we shall work in, in order to prevent conflicts during merging.
This is how the sections are:
1. The landing page/banner section is the first page, with the class section-1-banner
2. The Our Guarantee section is the second page, with the class section-2-our-guarantee
3. The Mission & Values section is the third page, with the class section-3-mission-values
4. The 6 Things You Should Know about us is the fourth page, with the class section-4-six-things
5. The Our Products section is the fifth page, with the class section-5-our-products
6. The Testimonials (What our Clients Say About Us) section is the sixth page, with the class section-6-testimonials
7. The Next Steps section is the seventh page, with the class section-7-next-steps
8. The Blog section is the eighth page, with the class section-8-blog
9. The Footer section is the ninth and last page, with the class section-9-footer

## NB. 
1. I have included everything you will need to work with Bootstrap components within your respective sections
2. The site's default font will be the Poppins font. I have already added a link to Poppins font provided by fonts.google.com
3. The default font-size I have set for the body is 10px so that we can stick to using the em property for all our font related styles
4. Also, let's stick with the use of view-height(vh) and view-width(vw) instead of Pixels.
